 Learn to build a REST API with Express.js
 first we will create a simple route
 API - Application Programming Interface
 Express.js - A web application framework for Node.js
 Node.js - A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
 API is a set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other
 REST - Representational State Transfer
 CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete

 RESTful API - An API that follows the principles of REST
 HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol
 GET - Retrieve data from the server
 POST - Send data to the server
 PUT - Update data on the server
 DELETE - Delete data from the server
 JSON - JavaScript Object Notation
 Middleware - A function that has access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle
 Body Parser - A middleware that parses the request body and makes it available under req.body
 CORS - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
 Mongoose - A MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment
 MongoDB - A NoSQL database

  ________________HTTP METHODS____________________
  _--------------------------------------------------
  GET - Retrieve data from the server
  POST - Send data to the server  
  PUT - Update data on the server
  DELETE - Delete data from the server
  PATCH - Apply partial modifications to a resource

  ________________ENDPOINTS____________________
  _--------------------------------------------------
  WHAT IS AN ENDPOINT?
  An endpoint is a combination of a URL and an HTTP method that lets the client interact with a specific resource on the server.
  For example, the endpoint /api/users is a combination of the URL /api/users and the HTTP method GET, which retrieves a list of users from the server.

  **//what is an endpoint?**
// An endpoint is a specific URL where an API can be accessed by a client application. It is a point of interaction between the client and the server, allowing the client to send requests and receive responses.
